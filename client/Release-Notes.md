## In This Release

The 1.2.0 version includes an update to the content sharing feature released prior.  Earlier releases required a hardcoded html tag ID of "contentVideo".  This release allows the application developer to choose whatever value is desired for tag ID. 

Additionally, this release exposes the BlueJeans Roster which allows applications to list participants, and  respond to events generated by changes in Roster state/information.

The version 1.1.0 includes a feature enhancement to support the display of shared content from a BlueJeans meeting.  The SDK provides an ability to stream the content-share video to a `<video id="contentVideo">`tag, **and** an event callback that indicates state change of sharing.  Additionally, this release includes an API call to retrieve the WebRTC Client version.

The 1.0.3 version fixes the defect that prevented WebRTC from running on Chrome / Android.

The 1.0.2 release included a link to BlueJeans support site reference for network configuration to support WebRTC calling.  Support for WebRTC on Chrome running on Android is broken in this release. Firefox and Chrome on Windows and Mac are working as expected.

The 1.0.1 release contains all the WebRTC components to support both Chrome and Firefox browsers. These involved both back-end (webrtcsdk.min.js) as well as client-facing (webrtcclientsdk.js) files.  Additionally, these changes are included/exposed:

1. BlueJeans' RTCClient functions are exposed via the BJN.RTCClient object; they may be called by other application Javascript and frameworks.
   - example:  BJN.RTCClient.initialize();
2. The basic BlueJeans' client function endpoints available to applications are listed here.  Refer to the documentation provided in the README file for more detailed information:
   1. initialize()
   2. setVideoBandwidth()
   3. joinMeeting()
   4. leaveMeeting()
   5. toggleVideoMute()
   6. toggleAudioMute()
   7. changeAudioInput()  - (May require information not currently exposed in this release)
   8. changeAudioOutput()  - (May require information not currently exposed in this release)
   9. changeVideoInput()  - (May require information not currently exposed in this release)
   10. version() 
3. As provided in this reference application, BlueJeans delivers a video feed sized for 1024 x 768.  If the HTML web page needs to change the dimensions (4:3) it should use the CSS `transform: scale (xscale,yscale);`  operation on the <video> element.



### Known Limitations

1. **Single Meeting Session** SDK is limited to support connection to one, and only one BlueJeans meeting per page refresh.  If the application needs to join a follow-on meeting, the web page and BlueJeans WebRTC Framework must be reloaded (refresh page).  This limitation will be addressed in a future release.
